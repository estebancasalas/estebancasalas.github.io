						<p> Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (IA) and computer science, which
							focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical model that enables computers and
							machines to learn from and be able to make predictions or classifications on the data provided.
							It involves the use of mathematical and statistical techniques to enable systems to improve
							their performance on a specific task through experience and data driven learning. Machine
							learning algorithms are classified in: Supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised and
							reinforcement. (https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning)</p>

						<p>
						<h2>Supervised:</h2>
						A supervised learning where you have input variables X and an output variable Y and use an algorithm
						to
						learn the mapping function from the input to the output. The majority of practical machine learning
						uses
						supervised learning for their algorithms.
						The idea of this process is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input
						variables,
						the function is able to predict the output variables Y for the data. It is called supervised
						learning because
						we have the correct answers to the mapping of the output variables and are then able to adjust the
						function
						based on the guessing of the output. The training of an algorithm stops when it achieves an
						acceptable level of
						performance.
						Supervised learning problems can be also grouped into regression and classification.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Classification: </strong>
								Classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as red or blue or
								disease
								and no disease. An example of this type of algorithm is Linear regression.</li>
							<li><strong>Regression: </strong>A regression problem is when the output variable is a real
								value,
								such as dollar or weight. An example of this type of algorithm is Support vector</li>

							Random forest is an example of both of these types of Unsupervised learning.
						</ul>

						<h2>Unsupervised:</h2>
					
						<p>
							Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not have the correct answers to the mapping
							of the input variables. The goal of unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or
							distribution of the data in order to learn more about it, algorithms are left on their own to
							discover and present the interesting structure in the data.
							Unsupervised machine learning problems are divided in clustering and association:
							<ul>
								<li> <strong>Clustering: </strong>A clustering problem is when you want to discover the inherent
									groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchase behavior</li>
								<li><strong>Association: </strong>An association rule learning problem is where you want to
									discover
									the rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy A also want to
									buy B.</li>
							</ul>
						<p>
						<h2>Semi-Supervised</h2>
						<p>Semi supervised learning problems lay between supervised and unsupervised learning. What happens is that 
							there is  a lot of data available and some part is labeled and the other is not. Some common approaches to 
							these problems are to use unsupervised algorithms to discover and learn the structure of the data, or use 
							supervised algorithms to predict the label on the unlabeled data and then feed this data again to the 
							algorithm to then predict the new unseen data.</p>
						
						<h2>Reinforcement</h2>
						<p>Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that allows the agent to decide the
						best next action based on its current state, by learning behaviors that will maximize the reward
						signal in the environment. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in that
						supervised learning trains the model on a known dataset, while reinforcement learning trains the
						agent via rewards and punishments. The agent learns without intervention from a human by maximizing
						its reward and minimizing its penalty. Reinforcement learning is used in applications where the
						agent is expected to operate in a dynamic environment and must continually adapt its behavior to
						maximize its reward. (https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning)
